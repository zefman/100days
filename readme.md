# 100 days of code 🤖

I have half heartedly tried to learn WebGL and GLSL a number of times, and it has never really clicked 🤯, so I have decided to use the [#100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge as a way to help me commit to learning. 😬

This project will be where I keep my learnings along the way. 

Take a look at the results here 🧐: [100days.jozefmaxted.co.uk](https://100days.jozefmaxted.co.uk)
